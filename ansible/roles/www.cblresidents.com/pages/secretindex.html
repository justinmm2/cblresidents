			Welcome to the Clara Barton/Lafayette Residents' Site!
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>A number of Clara Barton residents are concerned by the secrecy and actions and inaction of the current board. We are attempting both to increase the number of seats on the board, as well as recall three-fifths of the existing board. <a href="proxyletter.pdf">A more detailed version of our reasoning is available</a>. This is a summary:</b>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>The building does not have audited financial statements</b>. At a recent board meeting, the board acknowledged to the unit owners that there has not been a signed audit of the condominium books since 2006.</li>
				<li><b>The board operates in secret</b>. The board is unable or often refuses to answer owner questions at board meetings. Numerous decisions are made during the executive sessions, and without owner input, despite requests for more decisions to be made during the public portion of the meeting.</li>
				<li><b>HOA increases are not explained</b>. The rationale for the increase in HOA fees has not been explained; we have experienced budget surpluses.</li>
				<li><b>Rooftop bathrooms repeatedly flood residents</b>. Residents under the rooftop bathrooms have been repeatedly flooded; it took roughly seven (7) <b>years</b> for the board to take decisive action.</li>
				<li><b>Hallway paint and carpet</b>. Carpet replacement ran almost four (4) years behind schedule, and was performed with minimal owner input. Repainting was done in the same manner, and was suspended after the prep stage due to owner feedback. Many owners feel they are now making decisions under duress simply to have decent hallways again.</li>
				<li><b>Common area furniture</b>. The common area furniture, including the rooftop and pool furniture, is past the end of its useful life, and common areas have not been well-maintained.
				</ul>
			Please see <a href="proxyletter.pdf">more detailed explanation for more information</a>. If you are unable to attend the meeting, a number of residents on each floor have volunteered to accept your proxy form so that they may vote on your behalf. Their names are in the linked PDF. Additionally, a number of residents are happy to answer questions on the cb-improvers mailing list. See below for information on joining!
